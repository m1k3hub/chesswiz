# ChessBase WMV/WMA Synchronization RE Notes

Status: active reverse engineering, updated 2026-08-30.

This document records observations from the locally available CBM168 media
fixtures. It deliberately distinguishes facts observed from hypotheses that
still require validation against ChessBase/Fritz.

## Confirmed container structure

The sampled `.wmv` files are ASF containers with three streams:

| ASF stream | Type | Observed format |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | video | WMV3 or VC-1/WVC1 |
| 2 | audio | WMA2 (`wmav2`) |
| 3 | script/data | ASF script-command media type |

The stream-3 type GUID is:

```text
59dacfc0-59e6-11d0-a3ac-00a0c90348f6
```

This is not an arbitrary unknown binary stream. It is an ASF script-command
stream. Microsoft documents script streams as timestamped type/argument pairs
delivered in presentation-time order.

The sampled base file `02 Mar del Plata000.wmv` is 433.852 seconds long. Its
stream 3 contains 149 packets and 389,574 bytes. Packet timestamps run across
the complete media duration. It has 76 packets of exactly 30 bytes and larger
packets ranging from approximately 4.3 KiB to 6.8 KiB.

## ChessBase payload encoding

The stream-3 packet payload is represented as UTF-16LE-shaped characters. The
first three code units are consistently:

```text
G A NUL
```

The remaining printable code units use a custom 64-character alphabet:

```text
'?' = 0, '@' = 1, 'A' = 2, ..., '~' = 63
```

Every four six-bit values decode to three binary bytes. This is similar to
Base64 packing, but the source alphabet is ASCII `0x3f` through `0x7e` and
must be converted by subtracting `0x3f`; it must not be mapped to the normal
Base64 alphabet by adding an ASCII offset.

After this decoding, the payload is structured binary data containing plain
ASCII strings and integers. The first decoded byte is significant; it is not
part of the six-bit transport header.

## Decoded large records

Large packets decode to records beginning with:

```text
02 00 00 00
```

They contain game/header state. A representative
decoded record includes:

```text
Lysyj
Igor
Wan
Yunguo
China
CHN-chT
Mega2015 Update 36
Chessbase
Mihail,Marin
Hangzhou
Heibei
FIDE
```

The observed string convention is a one-byte length followed by a
null-terminated ASCII string. The exact integer-field layout is not yet
fully identified.

## Decoded compact records

### Stream census

The probe was run over all 259 local `.wmv` fixtures. It decoded 6,368
script packets. The observed leading opcodes were:

```text
02  3294 packets  large state/checkpoint records
03  1293 packets  compact state transitions
04   432 packets  additional record family, not yet identified
06   779 packets  additional record family, not yet identified
08     3 packets  additional record family, not yet identified
0e   567 packets  additional record family, not yet identified
```

This is important: `02` and `03` are not the whole ChessBase command
language. The decoder currently preserves and reports the other families but
does not assign semantics to them. A playback implementation that handles
only `02`/`03` would therefore be incomplete, even if it works for the
representative lecture.

Initial examples of the other families are now captured. They are compact
binary records rather than six-bit text payloads after transport decoding:

```text
04 00 00 00 00 02 00 00 20 10 01 00   (12 bytes)
06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 0c 00
   00 00 00 05 00 0c 02 27 3c 02 3c 33 (24 bytes)
08 00 00 00 00 00                     (6 bytes)
0e 00 00 00 0e 00                     (6 bytes)
```

The `06` example occurs at 60.642 seconds and the `04` example at 84.142
seconds in the Biel 2015 lesson. The `08` example occurs in an endgame lesson;
the `0e` example occurs at 0.642 seconds in the Biel lesson. Their lengths
and fields differ from the `03` transition, so they must be decoded as
separate record types. Their semantics are still unknown.

The Biel stream gives one useful constraint: `0e` records advance through
values `0e`, `0f`, `10`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `1b`, and `1c`
while following large records continue to report state id `0` (and later
`0x12`/`0x16`). Therefore the `0e` value is not simply the large-record state
id at offset 8. It is likely a separate timeline/object identifier or a
substate selector. This prevents treating every compact record as a direct
state lookup.

The Biel lesson also shows that the `06` and `04` records are sparse relative
to the `0e` sequence. `06` appears at 60.642, 170.642, and 343.142 seconds
with payloads containing repeated structural fields (`...01 00 0c 00...` or
`...02 00 07 00...`) followed by short value pairs. `04` appears at 84.142,
265.142, 279.142, 467.681, and 468.681 seconds. The latter two records are
adjacent, showing that `04` is not merely a periodic checkpoint. These are
strong candidates for board/annotation actions, but the current evidence is
not sufficient to name individual fields or map them to squares.

Large records in this same lesson are cumulative snapshots: their decoded
length grows from 1311 bytes to 1509 bytes as the lesson progresses. Some
snapshots differ only at offset 8, while others append or modify sizeable
regions beginning around offsets 334, 378, 421, 635, 715, 1101, and 1217.
This pattern is consistent with a serialized lesson state accumulating
annotations or board objects, not with a fixed-size move tuple. The value at
offset 8 should consequently be treated as a snapshot selector, while the
rest of the record must be parsed before deriving board state.

Some fixtures also include a same-basename `.txt` export. It contains
timestamped `GA:` commands such as `0:00:01.5: GA:B_...` followed by the
encoded state payload. This is a useful oracle for packet framing and timing:
the text export preserves the original command timestamps, while the ASF
stream carries the same information as script packets. It is not a separate
game notation file.

Across 234 text exports, six command prefixes occur immediately after `GA:`:

```text
?_  5731
?o  4455
@_  2166
B_  1210
@?   742
A?     4
```

This is a better candidate for the command dispatch table than the decoded
leading integer alone. The prefix is part of the outer text/export encoding;
the binary opcode is produced only after decoding the command payload. The
counts also explain why a decoder built from one `.wmv` will miss substantial
parts of the format.

### Verified prefix-to-opcode dispatch

The outer encoding is the same six-bit packing used by the ASF probe, but the
text export omits the UTF-16LE-shaped `GA` wrapper. Decoding the characters
after `GA:` immediately produces the binary record header. Verified samples
establish this dispatch table:

```text
?_  -> 02 00 00 00   large state/checkpoint record
?o  -> 03 00 00 00   compact transition record
@?  -> 04 00 00 00   12-byte action record
@_  -> 06 00 00 00   variable-length action record
A?  -> 08 00 00 00   6-byte record
B_  -> 0e 00 00 00   6-byte selector/timeline record
```

This is now verified rather than inferred from frequency: for example,
`GA:B_????w????` decodes to `0e0000000e00`, `GA:?o????C????` decodes to
`030000000100`, and `GA:@?.......` samples decode with opcode `04`.
The remaining work is the field grammar and semantics of each binary record,
not the outer transport or opcode dispatch.

### Opcode `06` container grammar

The `06` family is not a single fixed-size record. After its eight-byte
header, it contains concatenated subrecords with this verified shape:

```text
u16 tag
u16 length
byte payload[length]
```

For example, a 24-byte record contains tag `1`, length `12`, and a 12-byte
payload. Longer records contain several such subrecords. Some payloads include
plain UTF-8 text, including lesson annotations such as `Quiet move no. 1!`,
`Stilller Zug Nr 3!`, and explanatory English sentences. Other payloads end in
short numeric pairs such as `02 1e 36`, consistent with board/object
references. The container framing is therefore solved; the tag-specific
payload semantics remain to be mapped.

The 30-byte stream packets decode to six-byte records with this recurring
shape:

```text
03 00 00 00 XX XX
```

Examples include:

```text
03 00 00 00 17 00
03 00 00 00 18 00
03 00 00 00 d6 00
03 00 00 00 d7 00
03 00 00 00 d8 00
```

These records are timestamped independently by ASF. Their value is a
little-endian 32-bit field. In the observed lecture, compact values precede
large records carrying the same state value at offset 8. For example, the
stream contains compact `d6`, compact `d7`, then a large record with state
value `d7`; later it contains compact `d8`, followed by large records with
state value `d8`. The same pattern occurs for the `18`, `19`, `1a`, `1b`, and
subsequent values.

This establishes a state-transition/checkpoint relationship. It is stronger
than the earlier hypothesis that these were arbitrary event IDs, although the
contents of each state and the exact meaning of the transition opcode `03`
remain to be decoded.

## Role of `.cms`

The `.cms` files are separate indexes associated with a media directory. They
contain a base media name and FEN-like position records whose names include
values such as:

```text
x0y0v4u0
x24y25v3u2
x26y43v3u2
x34y43v2u5
```

The sibling directory contains a base video (usually `*000.wmv`) and
position-specific WMV clips. The evidence supports this division:

```text
.cms  -> selects/locates lesson branches and position clips
.wmv  -> carries audio, video, and timestamped ChessBase script commands
```

The `.cbm` file is a media catalog/manifest and is not itself the authoritative
playback timeline.

## Implications for Scidb

The current linear mapping of video time to game ply in
`tcl/app-media-sync.tcl` is not ChessBase-compatible. Authentic playback must
consume stream 3 and apply its commands at ASF presentation timestamps.

`tkvlc` currently renders the audio/video portion but does not expose the ASF
script-command stream to Tcl. A faithful implementation therefore needs one of:

1. a native ASF/WMF stream reader that exposes stream 3;
2. an FFmpeg/libavformat bridge that forwards stream-3 packets to Tcl; or
3. a standalone pre-parser that builds a timestamped Scidb synchronization
   sidecar before playback.

No one of these implementation paths has been selected yet.

## Next RE tasks

1. Recover the exact six-bit decoder and packet framing as a reusable probe.
2. Parse all large records and identify their integer/string field boundaries.
3. Diff consecutive records at adjacent timestamps.
4. Correlate compact records with the `.cms` FEN sequence and known game moves.
5. Validate the decoded event sequence against ChessBase/Fritz playback.
6. Only then replace the current approximation in Scidb.

## Evidence and references
